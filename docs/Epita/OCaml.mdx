# Get started with OCaml on macOS

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](../../Tools/Homebrew)
- or [Nix](../../Tools/Nix)
- An IDE (Emacs, VSCode, ...)


## Installation

To install OCaml, you can use brew or Nix to install the `opam` package.
`opam` is a package manager for OCaml. It will allow you to install OCaml and other packages.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="brew" label="Brew">

```bash
brew install opam
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nix" label="Nix">

```bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.opam
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Initialization

To initialize Opam, you can use the following command:

```bash
opam init
eval $(opam env)
```

## Install additional packages

Many packages are required to work with OCaml. Here is a list of packages to install:

```bash
opam install dune utop merlin ocp-indent ocaml-lsp-server tuareg
```

- utop: An interactive terminal for OCaml, useful for quickly testing functions.
- merlin, ocp-indent, ocaml-lsp-server: Tools to be able to use OCaml with your favorite IDE (VSCode, Vim, Emacs, ...).
- dune: A tool to compile your OCaml projects, necessary for the AFIT project
- tuareg: A mode for Emacs for editing OCaml code

In addition, if you like unit tests, you can install the `alcotest` package:

```bash
opam install alcotest
```

## Execute OCaml code

It's easy, just run the `ocaml` command in your terminal, or `utop` if you have installed the `utop` package:

```bash
❯ ocaml
        OCaml version 4.13.1
# let x = 42;;
val x : int = 42
# x * 2;;
- : int = 84
```

## Configure your IDE

You can use your favorite IDE to work with OCaml.
The IDE recommended for OCaml by Epita is [Emacs](../../Tools/Emacs), but you can use any IDE that supports OCaml.

### Emacs

There is a big advantage of using the tuareg mode for Emacs: you can copy-paste the content of a buffer into an `ocaml` instance directly from Emacs.

You can configure OCaml with the following `.emacs` file (which is located in your home folder `/Users/<your name>/.emacs` on Mac).
If you already have an `.emacs` file, you can simply add the lines at the end of your file.

```emacs-lisp title=".emacs"
(require 'package)
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
(package-initialize)

; Suggest installing the tuareg mode if needed
(unless (require 'tuareg nil 'noerror)
  (if (y-or-n-p "Il manque le mode tuareg, appuyer sur 'y' pour l'installer automatiquement")
    (progn
      (package-refresh-contents)
      (package-install 'tuareg))))
; Suggest installing ocp-indent if needed
(unless (require 'ocp-indent nil 'noerror)
  (if (y-or-n-p "Il manque ocp-indent, appuyer sur 'y' pour l'installer automatiquement")
    (progn
      (package-refresh-contents)
      (package-install 'ocp-indent))))
```

When you open a `.ml` or `.mli` file, Emacs should automatically use the `tuareg` mode
to color the code, and add a `Tuareg` menu in the menu bar.

The shortcuts are as follows:
- `C-c C-e` : Execute the current line
- `C-c C-r` : Execute the selected region
- `C-c C-k` : Kill the current buffer


### VSCode

We recommend using the [OCaml Platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform) extension.
It allows you to use OCaml with VSCode, and to have full support for `.ml` and `.mli` files (syntax highlighting, autocompletion, ...).


## Manage multiple OCaml environments

If you need to manage multiple OCaml environments, you can use `opam switch` to create virtual environments.

For example, to create a virtual environment `ocaml-4.13.1` with OCaml 4.13.1, you can use the following command:

```bash
opam switch create ocaml-4.13.1 4.13.1
eval $(opam env)
```

You can then use `opam switch` to switch between different virtual environments.

```bash
❯ opam switch
#   switch   compiler                    description
->  4.13.1   ocaml-base-compiler.4.13.1  4.13.1
    default  ocaml.4.14.0                default
```

:::info
When changing virtual environment, you may need to reinstall the additional packages you had installed previously.
