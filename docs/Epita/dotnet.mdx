# C#/.NET on MacOS

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](../../Tools/Homebrew)
- or [Nix](../../Tools/Nix)
- Rider (or Visual Studio, Rider is recommended by the school, because it is compatible with Linux, and is accessible during exams)

## Introduction

.NET is a framework developed by Microsoft, which allows the development of applications in C#. .NET is available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
It is the framework used by the school for the first year C# courses at EPITA, supervised by the assistants (ACDC).


## Installation

To install .NET, you have several options.
You can install Rider, which will propose to install .NET during the first launch, or install it manually using the command line.
Let's start by installing Rider.

### Rider
Rider is an IDE developed by JetBrains, which is compatible with .NET, C#, and Mono. It is available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
To install it, simply go to the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and download the macOS version.
:::tip
You can also install Rider through the [JetBrains ToolBox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), which will allow you to manage all of your JetBrains IDEs from a single application.
:::

:::tip
If you are a student, you can obtain a free license for all of JetBrains IDEs by logging in with your student email [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/community/education/#students).
:::
When you launch Rider for the first time, it will offer to install .NET.
Accept this and allow the installation to proceed.
Take note, it will only offer to install the latest version of .NET, which might not be compatible with certain projects or what the teaching assistants ask for.
To install a specific version, you will need to use the command line.

### Command line

To install .NET with Homebrew or Nix, simply run the following command:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="brew" label="Brew">

        ```bash
        brew install dotnet # Installe la derni√®re version de .NET
        brew install dotnet@7 # Installe la version 7 de .NET
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nix" label="Nix">

        ```bash
        nix-env -iA nixpkgs.dotnet-sdk_VERSION # Install a specific version of .NET
        # change VERSION with the version you want to install (eg: 5.)
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can search on [search.nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=22.11&show=dotnet-sdk_7&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=dotnet)
the exact name of the package to install. Be careful to take the package that contains `dotnet-sdk` and not `dotnet-runtime`.

### Manual installation

You can go to the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) to download the desired version of .NET.

## Usage

### Creating a project

To create a project, click on `New Solution` in the Rider home window, then choose `Console Application`.
Be careful to choose `.NET/.NET Core` and not `.NET Framework`.

### Adding a NuGet package


In the bottom bar of Rider, you will see a `NuGet` tab, click on it to open the NuGet package management window.
You can then search for the desired package and install it.

You can also add a NuGet package by adding the following line to your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="PACKAGE_NAME" Version="VERSION" />
</ItemGroup>
```
