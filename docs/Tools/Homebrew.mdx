# Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS.
You can use it to install software from your terminal.

## Installation

To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Usage

### Install a package

To install a package (formula in Brew terminology), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install <formula> [<formula> ...]
```

:::note
Some packages are casks (graphical applications). To install them, use the command `brew install --cask <formula>`.
When in doubt, you should search for the package on [the Homebrew website](https://formulae.brew.sh/) or via the command `brew search <formula>`.
:::

:::note
When you install a package, Homebrew also updates all the packages already installed, which can take some time!
:::

### Uninstall a package

```bash
brew uninstall <formula> [<formula> ...]
```

### Update Homebrew

To update Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew upgrade <formula> [<formula> ...]
```

## Install Intel packages on Apple Silicon

If you are using a Mac with an Apple Silicon chip (M1/M2/M3), you can install Intel packages thanks to Apple Rosetta 2.

Why? Because some packages are not yet available in native version for Apple Silicon.
You can check [this list](https://isapplesiliconready.com/) to see if your packages are available in native version.

If you haven't activated Rosetta 2, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

Then, to install an Intel package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
arch -x86_64 brew install <formula> [<formula> ...]
```
> `arch -x86_64` permet d'ex√©cuter une commande en mode Intel.
