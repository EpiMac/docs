## Features limitations

As you embark on the journey of installing and exploring Asahi Linux on your
Apple Silicon Mac, we want to ensure that you are **fully informed** about the
current state of hardware and software support.

While Asahi Linux represents a significant leap forward in running Linux on
Apple Silicon, it's important to be aware of certain features and
functionalities that are not yet supported or are in the early stages of
development.

Unsupported Features You Should Know About :
- **Hardware-Specific Features:** Certain Apple-specific hardware features, such
as the Touch Bar on some MacBook models, might not be functional.

- **Power Management:** While significant progress has been made, power
management features may not be entirely on par with macOS, potentially affecting battery life and thermal performance.

- **Wireless Connectivity:** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities might have
limited support, depending on your specific Mac model.

:::caution
We recommend that users who rely heavily on these features for their
day-to-day activities consider the current supported
[features](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) and
current broken [software](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Broken-Software)
before installing Asahi Linux.
