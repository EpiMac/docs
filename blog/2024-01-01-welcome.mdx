Hello Folks !

To celebrate the new year and the beginning of a lot of projects, we are happy to announce that we are launching our blog !

Inspired by some other famous blogs like Korben or MacGeneration, we wanted to create something truly unique and focused on what we do here at EpiMac.

That's why here in this blog, we will talk about our projects, we'll show you some behind the scenes of our projects, share some tips and tricks about Apple devices and so on.

We hope you'll enjoy it !
